# 5 Ways of Calling Java from Python

Some of my notes on calling Java from Python, only lightly edited from the raw notes. Short, mostly installation script and hello world code, but should serve the purpose.

Short answer: Jpype works pretty well, but Pyjnius is faster and
simpler than JPype

## Summary

2013-05-21T22:38:11 (PDT) **Pyjnius** is faster and simpler than JPype

- **JCC**, **javabridge**, Jpype and Jnius are all JNI wrappers.

2012-06-14T10:33:00 (PDT) **Jpype** works pretty well. I can call Stanford parser and OpenNLP from Python

2012-05-05T17:57:57 (PDT) close for now. At lease I can use **Jpype**. Reopen a**Py4j** task in the future if Jpype is not enough
